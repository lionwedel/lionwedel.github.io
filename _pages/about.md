About Me
======
Hi! I am Lion, a computational social scientist. I studied sociology and economics during my bachelor's and something related to computer science, psychology, and ethics during my master's. Since November 2022, I have worked as a research associate at the Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society in Berlin while pursuing a PhD in Communications Science at the FU Berlin. 

What have I learned from that messy disciplinary Background? Most of the time, disciplines are just different labels for similar things.
To serve a more profound conclusion, Academia is a lovely playground, and I enjoy many of its facades. Be it theorizing ethics, politics, or the philosophy of science, data- or theory-driven research on large-scale digital trace data, or pushing the development of new methods in the social sciences.

In line with that, my research is focused on those three fields:
I pursue ...
1.) ... contributions to the audience's perception of informative content and actors on social media.
2.) ... to push the boundaries of computational methods applied in social science research (multi-modal classification, GenAI as a method).
3.) ... empirical research on socially relevant phenomena (information dynamics on TikTok, online misogyny).
