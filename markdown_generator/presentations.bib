  abstract = {This methodological contribution explores the potential of augmented Data Download Packages (aDDPs) as a novel approach to analyze digital trace data, using TikTok as a use case to demonstrate the broader applicability of the method. We demonstrate how these data packages can be used in social science research to understand user behavior, content consumption patterns, and the relationship between self-reported preferences and actual digital behavior. We introduce the concept of aDDPs, which extend the conventional Data Donation Packages (DDPs) by augmenting the collected data with survey data, metadata, and multimodal content embeddings, among other possibilities. Specifically, this study uses the combination of data components in aDDPso facilitate research on user endorsement behavior and content classification. This work provides an overview and, consequently, guidance for collecting and augmenting DDPs on TikTok and beyond. In a pilot study on 18 aDDPs, we showcase the potential of the information breadth that can be collected and integrated. We train and compare uni- and multimodal classifiers, classify the 18 aDDPs, and investigate the extent to which endorsement behavior impacts future content suggestions. Finally, we contrast the empirical findings with the users' self-reported content consumption. This study shows that aDDPs open up new spheres of research. With such a procedure, researchers are not merely bound to the information the donations carry but can investigate a plethora of questions that rely on classifications that the platforms do not provide. Questions on the distribution of anti-vax (Kim et al., 2023) or sexualized content (George \& Surdeanu, 2023) can be expanded with an user centered perspective: what do users actually see, and how to they react to it? Besides supervised machine learning, an aDDP also provides data for unsupervised machine learning tasks to exploratively investigate content from digital platforms.},
