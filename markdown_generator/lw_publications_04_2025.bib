  abstract = {TikTok is rapidly gaining momentum as a leading social media platform for the production, dissemination, and consumption of tailor-made short (news) videos. Thus far, the narrow body of scholarship on the intersection of TikTok and news has predominantly highlighted the production processes and output of traditional journalists working at legacy news organisations, neglecting non-traditionally journalistic users producing news-like videos. We conduct various computational analyses on all \#news and/or \#nachrichten videos uploaded to TikTok in 2023 from within Germany, Austria, or Switzerland, comparing the videos from 17 major journalistic news outlets with those from general users. To pinpoint differences between videos labeled as news-related by professional news outlets and ordinary users, we structure our research around hashtag, auditory and visual characteristics, the key elements of content creation, and - in such a combination - unique to TikTok. Our results show clear differences between the two video creator sets in the hashtag and visual characteristics but similarities in the auditory.},

  abstract = {This research explores the potential of augmented Data Download Packages (aDDPs) as a novel approach to analyze digital trace data, using TikTok as a use case to demonstrate the broader applicability of the method. The study demonstrates how these data packages can be used in social science research to understand better user behavior, content consumption patterns, and the relationship between self-reported preferences and actual digital behavior.We introduce the concept of aDDPs, which extend the conventional Data Download Packages (DDPs) by augmenting the collected data with survey data, metadata, content data, and multimodal content embeddings, among other possibilities - rendering aDDPs an unprecedentedly rich data source for social science research. This work provides an overview and guidance on collecting, augmenting DDPs, and analyzing the resulting aDDPs.In a pilot study on 18 aDDPs, we use the combination of data components in aDDPs to facilitate research on user engagement behavior and content classification. We showcase the potential of the information breadth and depth that aDDPs depict by exploiting the combination of multimodal content embeddings, the users' watch history, and survey data. To do so, we train and compare uni- and multimodal classifiers, classify the 18 aDDPs' videos, and investigate the extent to which user engagement behavior impacts future content suggestions. Furthermore, we compare the users retrieved content with the users' self-reported content consumption.},
